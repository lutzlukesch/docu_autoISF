Please note that with autoISF you are in an early-dev. environment, 
where the user interface is not optimized for safety of users who stray 
away from intended ways to use. Good safety features exist, 
but these are  only as good as the development-oriented user understands and 
implements  them. This is not a medical product, refer to disclaimer in [Section 0](chapter_0.md)
