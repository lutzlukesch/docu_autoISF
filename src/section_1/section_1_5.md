## 1.5 Meal-related limitations?

Setting up a full closed loop is relatively easy for people whose diet does not consist mainly of
	components with rapid high effect on blood glucose (more see
	https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage/FullClosedLoop.html#meal-related-limitations )


Meals do not have to be low on carb (provided you use a fast insulin for your FCL)
	Fat or protein rich diets, or slow digestion/gastroparesis, make things easier rather than harder for
	the full closed loop because late carbs nicely cover for inevitable “tails” of late action from SMBs
	needed before or around peak time.


Erratic consumption of smaller snacks with fast resorbing carbs can be a problem.
	
`In autoISF you can reduce this problem to some extent via one or two keystrokes from your
	AAPS home screen. While certainly being a deviation from the FCL idea(l), this would be
	one of the exceptional situations where you better do a quick “nudging” step from your “FCL
	cockpit”. Details see in section 5.2.1 and 5.3.3.1 (4) and case study 5.2`  --> link to be added

	
<> <blockquote> Really, there are no meal limitations.
	The sketched more problematic options just force you to decide which extra “nudging”
	efforts and/or worsened %TIR (and/or “behavioral adjustments”, like less snacking) you are
	willing to accept, occasionally.</blockquote>
