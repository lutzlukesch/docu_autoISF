## 1.4.2 Libre 3 CGM with 1 minute values


Libre 3 showed promising performance too, and using it with 1-minute values via Jugglucoo is 
integrated, starting with autoISF version 3.0.1. autoISF automatically detects whether values come 
through Jugglucoo, and adjusts parabola fit calculations to determine acceleration etc. 
- It is currently too early to tell, but the 1 minute values applied to the parabolic bg 
curve fit could present an avenue to earlier/better acceleration detection than the 5-minute CGMs enable.
- When running on Libre3 / 1 minute, you get many more SMBs that each are, on average, much smaller. This has implications on some related settings (notably, the smb_range_
extention, see [section 2.1](../section_2.md)).


Tests done prior to introducing the 1 minute Libre3 option (from autoISF 3.0.1 onwards) showed
overall comparable but smoother insulin delivery.
