# 1.6 Lifestyle-related limitations?


Providing a technically stable system

Full closed looping requires a 24/7 technically stable system, especially regarding
- reliable CGM signals 
- Bluetooth stability with the pump (see case study 1.4)
- keeping your phone in sufficient proximity at all times 
- avoiding (or at least early recognition of) occlusion.
	

This requires a habit (or, unlikely, permanent attention to details) like keeping all components well
	charged and in close proximity; making cannula (or pod) changes always early enough to lower the
	risk of occlusion (see case study 1.1); having always potentially needed parts with you.
	

Depending on your system, your experience with it, but also on your acceptance and general
lifestyle, these aspects may or may not limit you.



## Preparing for exercise

To prepare for exercise (sports, heavy work), the normal protocol with a pump or hybrid closed loop
	is to take actions that reduce insulin on board prior to exercise
	With your full closed loop, the algorithm is tuned to detect meals and to give you insulin to counter
	glucose rises automatically. Setting a high temp. target and lower %profile right away (effective al-
	ready around meal start) could be a problem.
	Unusual activity levels therefore likely require disciplined preparation (especially if you want to
	keep the need to snack during sports low)
	In autoISF you can reduce this problem to some extent via two or three keystrokes on your
	AAPS home screen. While certainly being a deviation from the FCL idea(l), this would be
	one of the exceptional situations where you better “flick a lever” from your “FCL cockpit” to
	keep iob low (example see case study 6.2).

## Extra hurdles to establish FCL for kids

To establish and maintain a FCL for kids brings about some extra challenges if:
- Lyumjev is not available or well tolerated 
- Hourly basal rate is very low, providing a poor basis for big SMBs
- Diet is rich in sweet components. With the typical low blood volume of a small body, strong
tendency towards very high bg spikes!
- Going through marked changes of insulin sensitivity or of circadian pattern makes it difficult 
to keep the FCL appropriately tuned.


This problem is about the same in Hybrid Closed Looping. However, now you might
	expect miracles from the FCL. This is not going to happen. You still must be pro-ac-
	tive by setting suitable temporary % profiles. (These serve as a basis, also for your
	autoISF FCL).
- Discipline may be poor regarding keeping Bluetooth connectivity and infusion sites perfectly	
running
- Between kid and supervising parent it must be guaranteed, especially in the initial weeks,
t an eye is kept on whether the FCL is working about as expected.
