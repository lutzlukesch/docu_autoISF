# General Settings for Full Closed Loop

When in Hybrid Closed Loop, big boli were given by the user, and the loop had no business to give
big ones on top. But this is fundamentally different now.

So, first we must **enable our loop to overcome the narrow safety restrictions for SMB sizes**
that were appropriate in HCL.
	Evidently, this could become dangerous. Please set your iobTH (section 2.4), and observe all
	suggestions made in this FCL-e-book *) , and in the github pages of the developers.

Caution: This entire e-book is about Full Closed Looping. In case you intend to work with giving boli,
many suggestions made - notably in this section 2 (and in section 4) â€“ should not be followed. You would have to do extra research, on your own data, how your bolus changes things.
Mainly use the documentations referred to in section 3, then. See also remarks in section 4.1and section 7
